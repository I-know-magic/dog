The Dog Gateway (Dog, for friends!) is an OSGi compliant implementation of a smart environment gateway and IoT platform featuring multi-protocol capabilities, REST-based application APIs, Uniform device representation, Rule-based activations, Realtime data elaboration (with complex event processing technologies), Xively integration (to enable social sharing of consumptions and activations), etc.

The Dog Gateway development team is striving to improve and enrich the gateway day by day, and as result of this effort, several new features are currently on the way such as: integration of EnOcean devices, Philips Hue interoperability, Android example apps, etc.
